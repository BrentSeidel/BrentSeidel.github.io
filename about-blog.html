title: About my Blog
---
<p>My blog is irregularly updated and will mostly cover technology related items of interest
to me.  This is not to say that something else will never appear, but those posts should
be in the minority.</p>

<p>Index of blog posts:</p>
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      {{ post.date }} - <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
