  <div class="post-content">
    <h3 id="welcome-to-my-page">Welcome to my page</h3>
<p>This is apparently a beautiful page using a handsome template that GitHub has provided for
my use.  It’s probably better than I can do handcrafting HTML.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the layout that I selected for the main page using GitHub’s automatic page
generator doesn’t seem to propagate to the other pages.  So, in order to get consistent
formatting, I redid this page using the jekyll page generator and it now looks like the
others.</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>I first started programming in the late 70s on TRS-80 computers.  I chose those since I
could often find one in a Radio Shack store and talk the store personnel into letting me
play on it.  Since then. I’ve used a number of different languages.  In spite of this,
I’ve only taken about 4 programming classes so I am largely self taught.  My formal
training is as an electrical engineer (B.S.E) and systems engineer (M.Eng).  While I have
programmed for pay in various capacities over the years, I am mostly a hobbyist
programmer.  I would consider myself to be an advanced amateur programmer.</p>

<h3 id="about-my-projects">About my projects</h3>
<p>I have posted a few projects on GitHub both to provide a backup and version control for
myself and also to share with other people.  They are not all programming projects as I’ve
also posted some of the papers that I wrote for my masters degree.  I will probably dig up
some of my old projects and stick them up there so that they won’t get lost.  It will also
allow me to easily jump to another project when I get tired of what I am currently working
on.  And, who knows when I might get a sudden burst of inspiration for something.</p>

<p>You can find them at <a href="https://github.com/BrentSeidel">https://github.com/BrentSeidel</a></p>

<p>You can find my <a href="/about-blog.html">blog</a> where I occasionally write about
various things.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-page">About this page</h3>
<p>This is my first attempt at using GitHub’s automatic page generator.  I expect a lot of
changes at first, but things should eventually settle down.  I’ll probably also
occasionally add writings that don’t quite warrant a separate paper or add links to things
that I find interesting.</p>
