    <h2 id="then">Then</h2>
<p>Way back when I was a young lad, I’d seen on TV some of the wonderful things that computers
could do (whether this was in any way realistic is a topic for another discussion), and I
became fascinated with computers and wanted to be able to do wonderful things with them.
In those days, computers were mostly mainframes or minicomputers with microcomputers just
starting to be a thing.  We didn’t have enough money to afford any of them, but that didn’t
stop me from reading and learning as much as I could about them.</p>

<p>I would occasionally get asked by adults what kind of computer I would buy if I could.  Now,
if money were no object, I would probably have wanted to put an IBM mainframe in the basement.
Granted we would need a bigger basement and a new electrical service to the house.  Not that
I really had a good idea what I would have done with it beyond just “wonderful things”.  More
realistically, I poured over the ads in Byte and other magazines and would have really
liked an S-100 bus based computer that I could tinker with.  But I realized that these
adults probably didn’t want to do the same things that I did, so I would suggest something
like an Apple II, a TRS-80, or a Commodore PET.</p>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few years to now.  I have sitting on my desk next to my desktop computer a
little $55 computer that is probably more powerful the the IBM mainframes of my childhood.
Of course you can’t open up some cabinet and add or remove jumpers and there’s no front
panel with blinking lights.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>While the massive shrink in the size and cost of hardware is the most obvious change, there
are also other areas that have changed.</p>

<h3 id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</h3>
<p>Back then every computer vendor had an operating system or three.  Now it’s mostly Windows
or some flavor or clone of Unix.  In some ways this is a good thing, but I can’t help but
wonder if some good ideas have been lost along the way.</p>

<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>Back then, you looked at what you were doing and what hardware you were using to determine
which programming language(s) to use.  Granted, structured programming was just coming into
vogue and object oriented programming was still a laboratory curiosity.  Since then some
languages have fallen into disuse and new ones have appeared to take their place.  The nice
thing is that some of these new languages have interesting new ideas that offer different
ways to think about programming.  If one is interested in programming languages, there is
a wide variety of compilers and interpreters available for free.</p>

<h3 id="processors">Processors</h3>
<p>Then there was the “big iron” mainframe processors, some of which are still around.  Then
there was a number of minicomputers for those who still needed some computing power.  Finally,
there were these new microcomputers that were solutions in search of a problem.  The
categories broke down neatly based on the word size.  36 or 32 bit words meant a mainframe,
16 or 12 bits was a minicomputer, and 8 bits was a microcomputer.  It’s hard to believe now,
but there was a time when the size of a byte wasn’t fixed at 8 bits - it depended on the
computer you were using.  There were also a few 64 or 60 bit supercomputers.  Each
manufacturer often supported multiple processor architectures.  Now, it’s much easier just
to buy a processor from one of the processor manufacturers and use it.  The one to choose
now depends on what your requirements are.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h2>
<p>Sometimes one has to lift their head and look around.  Look forward to see where you are
going.  Look around to see what else is going on.  Look back to see where you were.  Sometimes
you might find that you missed something important.</p>
