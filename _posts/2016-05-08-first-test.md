This is a my first test blog post using Jekyll.

While GitHub will automatically create a page for you, it does take a bit of fiddling to
get jekyll working so that it can be extended.  The biggest problem is that the created
files from GitHub are not complete.  I have do "jekyll new" in an empty directory and copy
the missing pieces into my repository.  These are mainly the "_includes" and "_layouts"
subdirectories.

Once that was done, building the site with "jekyll build" and testing it with "jekyll serve"
worked.  Then push everything back to GitHub and what do you know.  It actually worked.
I was pleasantly surprised because I had read something that suggested that GitHub was
doing something different for blog posts.

There are still a few things to tinker with.  I expect that there will be a number of
changes coming in the look of things and I bang on some of the rough edges.
