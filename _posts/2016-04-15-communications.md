When talking with engineering students and new engineers, I sometimes get asked what the
most important skill is for engineers.  There are a number of possible answers, but I
think that one of the less recognized skills is communications.

Very rarely will one be given an unlimited budget and told to do, whatever by one's self.
Usually one will work as part of a team on a more or less well defined project.  Communication
will be needed with coworkers, manager, and depending on the project, upstream and downstream
users or customers.

Communication can take many forms ranging from a hallway conversation or a note scribbled
on a napkin to detailed documentation and analysis.  In between there are presentations,
summaries, white papers, trade studies, and the like.  During reviews and testing,
comments and problem reports are also used as communication.

If your team has a style guide, use it.  If it has some flaw, try to get them fixed.  In
general, it's better to deal with one suboptimal way of doing things than a dozen different
one.  This is not a creative writing class.  The purpose is to efficiently and, more importantly,
accurately transfer information to another person.

In my work as an engineer I've had to read and write a large number of documents.  Some of
them have been awful where I had to read something multiple time to try and figure out what
the author was trying to say.  On the other had, good documentation is always a pleasure.

For some of us, communication comes naturally.  The rest of us need to work on it.  Actually,
some form of communication comes naturally to most of us, but it might not be appropriate in
a work setting.  Theory and formal education can help, but the most important thing is to
practice and get feedback.  Note that good feedback is also a form of communication, so
multiple people can get to practice at once.
