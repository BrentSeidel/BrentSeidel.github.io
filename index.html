<a id="welcome-to-my-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my page</h3>

<p>This is apparently a beautiful page using a handsome template that GitHub has provided for my use.  It's probably better than I can do handcrafting HTML.</p>

<h3>
<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I first started programming in the late 70s on TRS-80 computers.  I chose those since I could often find one in a Radio Shack store and talk the store personnel into letting me play on it.  Since then. I've used a number of different languages.  In spite of this, I've only taken about 4 programming classes so I am largely self taught.  My formal training is as an electrical engineer (B.S.E) and systems engineer (M.Eng).  While I have programmed for pay in various capacities over the years, I am mostly a hobbyist programmer.  I would consider myself to be an advanced amateur programmer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="about-my-projects" class="anchor" href="#about-my-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About my projects</h3>

<p>I have posted a few projects on GitHub both to provide a backup and version control for myself and also to share with other people.  They are not all programming projects as I've also posted some of the papers that I wrote for my masters degree.  I will probably dig up some of my old projects and stick them up there so that they won't get lost.  It will also allow me to easily jump to another project when I get tired of what I am currently working on.  And, who knows when I might get a sudden burst of inspiration for something.</p>

<p>You can find them at <a href="https://github.com/BrentSeidel">https://github.com/BrentSeidel</a></p>
<h3>
<a id="about-this-page" class="anchor" href="#about-this-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About this page</h3>

<p>This is my first attempt at using GitHub's automatic page generator.  I expect a lot of changes at first, but things should eventually settle down.  I'll probably also occasionally add writings that don't quite warrant a separate paper or add links to things that I find interesting.</p>
